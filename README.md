# Ola-vs-Uber-Revenue-Analysis

### Key Points
-Analyzed booking data to identify revenue gaps, noting Uber’s higher profitability (79.98M vs Ola’s 38.76M) and higher successful bookings (70.19K vs 61.94K). 

-Evaluated pricing inefficiencies and peak-hour demand trends, highlighting Uber’s superior revenue optimization

-Identified pricing inefficiencies in Ola, where Prime SUVs and Autos generate similar revenue (~₹5.6M each), indicating underpricing, while Uber’s premium rides contribute higher revenue.

-Evaluated payment behaviors, noting that Uber benefits from higher digital transaction adoption, whereas Ola’s wallet and cash payments generate lower revenue with potential fraud risks.

-Assessed peak-hour demand trends (Uber: strong weekday trends, Ola: evening peak ~45K rides) and found Uber better aligns driver availability with demand, reducing missed revenue opportunities.

-Concluded that Uber maintains better revenue realization ($79.98M vs. Ola’s ₹38.76M) with higher successful bookings (70.19K vs. 61.94K), making it more profitable despite operational challenges.


### Why is Ola in Loss Despite High Revenue?

#### (a) High Cancellations Impacting Revenue

-25K rides were canceled, which is ~28.75% of total bookings.
-98.58% of cancellations were driver-initiated, leading to lost revenue and poor customer experience.
-High cancellations mean wasted marketing spend and missed revenue opportunities.


#### (b) Revenue vs Operational Costs Mismatch

-Total Booking Value = ₹38.76M (~₹3.87 Cr)
-Successful Bookings = 61.94K, meaning the actual revenue realization is lower than potential revenue.
-Driver incentives, fuel costs, and maintenance are eating into profits.
-Discounts/promos to attract customers reduce effective fares and squeeze margins.


#### (c) Pricing and Fare Structure Issues

-Long and Medium distances have similar fares (~₹390), which discourages long-distance rides.
-Revenue per ride seems low when factoring in operational costs like driver payouts, platform costs, and fuel.
-Prime SUV and Prime Sedan make similar revenue to Auto (~₹5.6M each), which suggests underpricing premium rides.


#### (d) Payment Method Issues

-Wallet and Cash transactions generate the least revenue, and these methods may have higher fraud risk or operational issues.
-UPI and Cards are dominant (~20% each), but if transaction fees are high, Ola might be losing a percentage on each ride.


#### (e) Demand vs Supply Mismatch

-Peak bookings happen in the Evening (~45K rides), but if driver availability is low, it leads to higher cancellations and loss of potential revenue.
-Key locations (DLF Phase 1, Gurgaon, etc.) have the highest ride distance and revenue—but if there’s low driver availability in these areas, rides get canceled.
